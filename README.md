## Introduction

    HikeOn is a powerful tool for organizing outdoor activities with ease and confidence. Perfect for planning picnics, hikes, and other group outings, this software combines convenience and safety. Users simply enter the type of event they’re planning (ex. a “hiking trip” or “picnic”) and the software provides curated location options, real-time weather data, and AI-driven tips specific to their chosen activity.

    Utilizing OpenWeather for accurate forecasts, Google Maps for nearby locations, and the OpenAI API for intelligent real-time advice, HikeOne ensures that users have everything they need for a successful outing. Whether you’re a seasoned hiker or planning a casual day out, HikeOn is your all-in-one solution for safe and memorable outdoor experiences.

3) Emma needs safety advice for her hiking trip. The app suggests bringing plenty of water and wearing sunscreen, as the weather is hot.

4) Emma wants to find a location ideal for both a picnic and a short hike. She enters "picnic and hiking" into the app, and it suggests locations suitable for both activities, along with weather updates and distance from her current location.

5) Emma has a free day and wants to do something outdoors, but she isn’t sure what activity would be suitable. She opens the app, which suggests activities based on the current weather, such as recommending a shaded trail on a hot day or a sheltered area if rain is expected. (Team - User Story)
